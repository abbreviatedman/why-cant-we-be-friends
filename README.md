# Why Can't We Be Friends?


### Introduction

We're going to collaborate through Git, and also get to know each other a little better. You'll eiher be better friends or move towards frenemies, but either way, you'll be closer.


### Assignment

You will ask each other a series of questions by collaborating on a README. Here's how it will work!

* One of you will start a new GitHub Repo with a README. Edit that readme to ask a question. *Make sure every single question is SFW, as you will be demo-ing this project!*
* Now push up, and tell your partner. Your partner will pull down, put in their answer to that question, and then ask YOU a DIFFERENT question.
* Then they will push up, tell you, and you will pull down and answer THEIR question.
* And repeat until ten total questions have been asked and answered (five each!).

### Resources

* Watch the video again if you're confused!
* If you get a merge conflict... delete the whole repo and clone it back down again. For now, that's our noob solution. I promise we'll learn more soon!
